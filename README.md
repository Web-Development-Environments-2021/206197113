I've built a website about Rick character from the Rick and Morty TV show.

aside from all the requested features needed to implement in the assignment I've added the following features:

- Back to top buttom, which hovers all around the website and pressing that buttom will direct to the top of the page.
- Enlarge photos when hovering in the My photos section.
- On the naviagtion bar, while hovering on the diffrent section, the color and background color will change in order to not be mistaken in the pressing.
- Each buttom that can be pressed is than changed into a clicked mouse instead of a regular mouse, in order to determine if a buttom is a click-able button.
